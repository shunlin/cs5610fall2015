They have subsequently been translated into dozens of languages including English.[2] He currently resides in Taiwan and Vancouver.","addDate":{"$date":"2015-12-01T21:40:41.490Z"},"author":["Tsai Chih Chung","Brian Bruya"],"__v":3,"sold":31.0,"title":"Zen Speaks: Shouts of Nothingness","comments":[{"_id":{"$oid":"565f82c3de7482f47ed73f54"},"grade":5,"content":"At first one might expect that cartoon is too informal a medium to convey the depth of a religion such as Zen. This book is beautiful in it's simplicity, the perfect starter for the religion. I recommend it as a gift to someone you love who is stressed out. Hopefully, Zen Speaks will help them to shine through adversity, as it has me. 6 stars.","title":"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful.","user":{"$oid":"565e8af6c5d9b88657d85a74"},"time":{"$date":"2015-12-02T23:46:11.424Z"}}]}
